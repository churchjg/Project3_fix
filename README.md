# Meal DB API/UI Pattern

## Introduction
For this project, I sourced an API from the mealDB API site - [Link] https://www.themealdb.com/api.php.
I was tasked with pairing this API data with a UI Pattern, I chose the Modal pattern. I then combined the two to create an interactive experience. 

## Development
I first built my main HTML and CSS structure of how I wanted the page to look using a wireframe. After that I used Javascript to push the data into the div classes within my overall container. After that, I spent time making sure the images appeared aestetically pleasing. I also added some mouse functionality so that images will become larger when you pan over them. 

## Challenges
I had major setbacks when I first started this project. I ended up having to start over 4 times due to bad API's. 

Originally, I had trouble trying to get the images to show up within the boxes I created in div classes. It turned out to be a control flow issue that I eventually solved. 


## Unsolved Problems
#1 I tried but could not find out how to make the scroll button show up within the modal. Sometimes the text inside of the modal (the recipe) will become to big for the modal and overflow. I want to make sure I can create a scroll box for this in the future.

#2 For some reason, the middle column of my CSS grid layout will not respond to the "mouseover" event I have created. I spent a lot of time trying to remedy this but could not figure it out.

#3 This site is not responsive but I have a clear idea of how I would like to make it responsive.
